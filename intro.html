                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>My name is <bold>Rahaf PERWEEN</bold>. I hail from Jamshedpur. However, I presently put up in Bengaluru / Bangalore.<br>
                    <br>
                    My latest educational qualification is a full time BE / B.Tech in <em>Computer Science from SJB Institute Of Technology, Bengaluru that will complete in Jul-2023. My GPA out of 10 is 9.19 and I am a College Topper.</em><br>
                    <br>
                    My degree in Computer Science has helped me develop all the requisite skills for the industry. Lately, I am trying to develop a habit of reading. I try to read the newspaper or any type of book or magazine I can lay my hands on.<br>
                    <br>
                    Moreover from time to time, I like to connect with seniors and cousins, who got placed at prestigious companies. They have worked very hard to be where they are and I seek motivation from them.<br>
                    <br>
                    <em>it comes to my project work exposure, I have spent about 2 Month(s) and during this tenure I worked on one gripping topic(s) like on Students result Analysis database. I think I should also tell you that I have done 12 Week(s) NPTEL-PROBLEM SOLVING THROUGH PROGRAMMING IN C, 12 Week(s) NPTEL-Programming in Java and 12 Week(s) NPTEL-INTRODUCTION TO ALGORITHM AND ANALYSIS.</em><br>
                    <br>
                    When it comes to schooling, I secured 85.75% in my XIIth CISCE(ICSE/ISC) Senior Secondary examination in 2019 in English medium with 92 marks in Maths and 73 marks in English. In Xth CISCE(ICSE/ISC) Board, I got 90.8%. My schooling as well as college years have had an immense contribution in modelling me as a wholesome individual. All through my academic years, I got many opportunities to contribute to projects and activities, as well as excel in them. My institutions have taught me that passion is the key to learning. Gradually I am also trying to polish my skills further so that I can contribute meaningfully within a team at a respected company like yours.<br>
                    <br>
                    To add that I am skilled in Java, C, Data Structures, Database Management System, Python, MySQL, HTML, Javascript, PHP, CSS, Mobile Application Development, Computer Graphics and System Software. I can read, write and speak in Urdu as well as read & write in Arabic.<br>
                    <br>
                    I would also like to add that I am a quick learner and believe in learning from my past mistakes as this is a virtue that can take me ahead in my life and career.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
